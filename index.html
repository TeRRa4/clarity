            <h1>John Doe</h1>
            <p>
                Midgard is a small Discord-based gaming community made of an odd group of people from all over the globe. We have
                interests in video games, anime, TV, movies, technology, coding, the sciences, mathematics, memes and much more.
                While we all play video games in our own time, and often together, when we are unable to play, we talk about
                anything and everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have bespoke, self-hosted Discord bots that spout memes on command, track the amount users talk for a competitive points-based
                activity leaderboard, play music from YouTube or SoundCloud in dedicated voice channels and six more that stream internet
                radio stations 24/7. We also have the Overseer, which makes sure the bots stay actives and notifies the admins if any go offline.
            <p>
                We're always open to new people joining us, so why not come in and join the fun?
